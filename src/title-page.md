# Rust Phrasebook for C++ Programmers

The goal of this book is to make programming in Rust less frustrating for C++
programmers by providing translations of common C++ idioms and patterns into
idiomatic Rust. Along with the translations, there are explanations of the
reasons for the differences and descriptions of the and engineering trade-offs
involved.

The translations are often not straightforward transliterations. Instead, they
are more comprehensive changes of to how to approach, using Rust, the kinds of
problems that the C++ idioms and patterns are intended to address.

The book is structured to make it possible to read it front-to-back. Ideally,
after reading this book, one's "idiom list" for Rust should be significantly
more robust, leading to a more enjoyable and productive experience programming
in Rust.

The chapters are also organized around C++ concepts instead of Rust concepts, to
aid C++ programmers in finding a specific solution to a problem in terms that
will be natural to them while they are learning Rust.

## Other resources

If you are not primarily a C or C++ programmer, [The Rust Programming
Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) may be a better starting point.

If you are primarily an embedded systems programmer using C or C++, this book is
a complement to [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).
