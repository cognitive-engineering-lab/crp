# C++ to Rust Phrasebook

This book is designed to help C++ programmers learn Rust. It provides translations of common C++ patterns into idiomatic Rust. Each pattern is described through concrete code examples along with high-level discussion of engineering trade-offs.

The book can be read front-to-back, but it is designed to be used random-access. 
When you are writing Rust code and think, "I know how to do this in C++ but not Rust," then
look for the corresponding chapter in this book.

This book was hand-written by expert C++ and Rust programmers to provide accurate information with a tasteful degree of detail. No text in this book was written by AI.

## Other resources

If you have zero Rust experience, you might consider first reading [The Rust Programming
Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) or getting a quick overview at [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/rust/).

If you are primarily an embedded systems programmer using C or C++, this book is
a complement to [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).

Compared to resources like the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) and [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/), this book is less about "Rust behind the scenes" and more about explicitly describing how Rust works in terms of C++.
