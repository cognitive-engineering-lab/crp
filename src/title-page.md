# C++ to Rust Phrasebook

The goal of this book is to make programming in Rust less frustrating for C++
programmers by providing translations of common C++ idioms and patterns into
idiomatic Rust. Along with the translations, we provide descriptions of the engineering trade-offs involved.
The translations are often not straightforward transliterations. They demonstrate how to holistically
follow Rust's philosophy in addressing systems programming problems through the lens of comparable C++ idioms.

The book can be read front-to-back, but is designed to be used random-access: 
when you are writing Rust code and think, "I know how to do this in C++ but not Rust", then
look for the corresponding chapter in this book.
The chapters are also organized around C++ concepts instead of Rust concepts, to
aid C++ programmers in finding a specific solution to a problem in terms that
will be natural to them while they are learning Rust.

**This iteration is a first draft of a subset of the full book. Our current goal is to get early feedback on the utility of this format before writing the remaining chapters.**

## Other resources

If you are not primarily a C or C++ programmer, [The Rust Programming
Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) may be a better starting point.

If you are primarily an embedded systems programmer using C or C++, this book is
a complement to [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).
