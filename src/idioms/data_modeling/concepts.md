# Concepts, interfaces, and static dispatch

When static dispatch over an interface is desired in C++, there are three
approaches that can be used, two of which are purely structural (i.e., they rely
only on the type having a matching method defined) and one of which is nominal.

The first is to define a template function that uses an `area()` method and rely
on it failing when it is used with a type that does not have that method. This
is significantly less restrictive than the other two C++ approaches, because it
does not require that `area()` return a `double`, only that it return a value
that can be promoted to a double.

```c++
#include <iostream>

struct Triangle {
  double base;
  double height;

  Triangle(double base, double height) : base(base), height(height) {}

  double area() { return 0.5 * base * height; }
};

template <class T>
double twice_area(T shape) {
  return shape.area() * 2;
}

int main() {
  Triangle triangle{1.0, 1.0};

  std::cout << twice_area(triangle) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The second C++ approach uses a concept to restrict the return type, but
otherwise is the same as the first.

```c++
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
concept shape = requires(T t) {
  { t.area() } -> std::same_as<double>;
};

struct Triangle {
  double base;
  double height;

  Triangle(double base, double height) : base(base), height(height) {}

  double area() { return 0.5 * base * height; }
};

template <shape T>
double twice_area(T shape) {
  return shape.area() * 2;
}

int main() {
  Triangle triangle{1.0, 1.0};

  std::cout << twice_area(triangle) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The closest equivalent to this in Rust is the following. Note that the
definition of the trait and the struct have not changed from the original
example using virtual methods and dynamic dispatch. Despite this, this example
does use static dispatch.

```rust
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Triangle {
    base: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Triangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        0.5 * self.base * self.height
    }
}

fn twice_area<T: Shape>(shape: T) -> f64 {
    2.0 * shape.area()
}

fn main() {
    let triangle = Triangle {
        base: 1.0,
        height: 1.0,
    };

    println!("{}", twice_area(triangle));
}
```

This is not quite the same as the above C++ programs because Rust requires that
the `Triangle` type explicitly declare that it implements the `Shape` interface,
while in the above C++ program the type implements the concept simply by virtue
of having defined a compatible method.

A closer equivalent to the above Rust program in C++ would be the following,
which uses a combination of pure virtual classes and concepts to achieve both
static dispatch and nominal typing.

```c++
#include <concepts>
#include <iostream>

struct Shape {
  Shape() {}
  virtual ~Shape() {}
  virtual double area() = 0;
};

template <typename T>
concept shape = std::derived_from<T, Shape>;

struct Triangle : Shape {
  double base;
  double height;

  Triangle(double base, double height) : base(base), height(height) {}

  double area() override { return 0.5 * base * height; }
};

template <shape T>
double twice_area(T shape) {
  return shape.area() * 2;
}

int main() {
  Triangle triangle{1.0, 1.0};

  std::cout << twice_area(triangle) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## Templates vs generic functions

The reason why Rust is nominally typed instead of structurally typed has to do
with the difference between C++ templates and Rust generic functions. In
particular, C++ templates are only type checked after all of the template
arguments are provided and they are fully expanded, while Rust generic functions
are type checked independently of the type arguments.

Since the functions are checked before the type arguments are known, the methods
and functions that can be applied to values of those types also need to be known
before the type arguments are known.

This point in the programming language design space favors simplicity of
reasoning about these functions over the flexibility that comes from the
template programming approach. This becomes especially valuable when writing
libraries that both provide generic functions and that use generic functions,
for which a C++ compiler can give many fewer static guarantees, since it would
not be possible to test all possible instantiations.

In both C++ and Rust, however, multiple implementations are generated by the
compiler in order to achieve static dispatch.

## Required traits and ergonomics

In the above examples, the function requiring a trait was defined like the following.

```rust,ignore
fn twice_area<T: Shape>(shape: T) -> f64 {
    2.0 * shape.area()
}
```

This is a commonly used shorthand for the following:

```rust,ignore
fn twice_area<T>(shape: T) -> f64
where
    T: Shape,
{
    2.0 * shape.area()
}
```

The more verbose form is preferred used when there are many type parameters or
those type parameters must implement many traits.
