# Concepts, interfaces, and static dispatch

In C++ static dispatch over an interface is achieved by implementing a template
function or template method that interacts with the type using some expected
interface.

The template function `twiceArea` in the example below makes use of an `area()`
method on the template type parameter.

To achieve the same goal in Rust involves defining a trait (`Shape`) with the
desired method (`twice_area`) and using the trait as a bound on the type
parameter for the generic function.

<div class="comparison">

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Triangle {
  double base;
  double height;

  Triangle(double base, double height)
      : base(base), height(height) {}

  // NOT virtual: it will be used with static dispatch
  double area() {
    return 0.5 * base * height;
  }
};

// Generic function using interface
template <class T>
double twiceArea(T &shape) {
  return shape.area() * 2;
}

int main() {
  Triangle triangle{1.0, 1.0};

  std::cout << twiceArea(triangle) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

```rust
// Interface that generic function will use
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Triangle {
    base: f64,
    height: f64,
}

// Implementation of interface for type
impl Shape for Triangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        0.5 * self.base * self.height
    }
}

// Generic function using interface
fn twice_area<T: Shape>(shape: &T) -> f64 {
    2.0 * shape.area()
}

fn main() {
    let triangle = Triangle {
        base: 1.0,
        height: 1.0,
    };

    println!("{}", twice_area(&triangle));
}
```

</div>

Note that in the Rust example, the definition of the trait and the struct have
not changed from the example in the chapter on [virtual methods and dynamic
dispatch](/idioms/data_modeling/pure_virtual_classes.md). Even so, this example
does use static dispatch. This is the result of a design trade-off in Rust
around the representation of vtables and vptrs which is [described later in that
chapter](/idioms/data_modeling/pure_virtual_classes.md#vtables-and-rust-trait-object-types).

The difference between Rust and C++ in the above examples arises from Rust being
nominally typed (types must opt in to supporting a specific interface, merely
having the right methods isn't enough) and C++'s template meta-programming
enabling a kind of structural or duck typing (types only need to have the
methods actually used, and there is no need to explicitly opt in to supporting
an interface).

## Templates vs generic functions

The reason why Rust is nominally typed instead of structurally typed has to do
with the difference between C++ templates and Rust generic functions. In
particular, C++ templates are only type checked after all of the template
arguments are provided and they are fully expanded, while Rust generic functions
are type checked independently of the type arguments.

Since the functions are checked before the type arguments are known, the methods
and functions that can be applied to values of those types also need to be known
before the type arguments are known.

This point in the programming language design space favors simplicity of
reasoning about these functions over the flexibility that comes from the
template programming approach. This becomes especially valuable when writing
libraries that both provide generic functions defined in terms of other generic
functions, for which a C++ compiler can give many fewer static guarantees, since
it would not be possible to test all possible instantiations.

In both C++ and Rust, however, multiple implementations are generated by the
compiler in order to achieve static dispatch.

## C++ constraints and concepts

Rust's approach to static dispatch over an interface can be partially (but only
partially) modeled with a strict application of [C++
concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints).

The usual way to apply concepts is still structural and does not model Rust's
approach: it only requires that a method with specific properties be present on
the type.

```cpp
#include <concepts>

template <typename T>
concept shape = requires(T t) {
  { t.area() } -> std::same_as<double>;
};

template <shape T>
double twiceArea(T shape) {
  return shape.area() * 2;
}
```

A closer equivalent to the above Rust program in C++ is to use a combination of
abstract classes and concepts.

```cpp
#include <concepts>

struct Shape {
  Shape() {}
  virtual ~Shape() {}
  virtual double area() = 0;
};

template <typename T>
concept shape = std::derived_from<T, Shape>;

struct Triangle : Shape {
  double base;
  double height;

  Triangle(double base, double height) : base(base), height(height) {}

  // still NOT virtual: will be used static dispatch
  double area() override {
    return 0.5 * base * height;
  }
};

template <shape T>
double twiceArea(T shape) {
  return shape.area() * 2;
}

int main() {
  Triangle triangle{1.0, 1.0};

  std::cout << twiceArea(triangle) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This is still not the same, however, because the concept only creates a
requirement on the use of the template, not on the use of values of type `T`
within the template. In Rust, the trait bound constrains both. So the following
still compiles in C++.

```cpp
#include <concepts>

struct Shape {
  Shape() {}
  virtual ~Shape() {}
  virtual double area() = 0;
};

template <typename T>
concept shape = std::derived_from<T, Shape>;

template <shape T>
double twiceArea(T shape) {
  // note the call to a method not defined in Shape
  return shape.volume() * 2;
}
```

However, the equivalent does not compile in Rust and instead produces an error.

```rust,ignore
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

fn twice_area<T: Shape>(shape: &T) -> f64 {
    // note the call to a method not defined in Shape
    2.0 * shape.volume()
}
```

```text
error[E0599]: no method named `volume` found for reference `&T` in the current scope
 --> example.rs:7:17
  |
7 |     2.0 * shape.volume()
  |                 ^^^^^^ method not found in `&T`
```

These additional static checks mean that in many situations where C++ templates
would be useful but hard to implement correctly, Rust generics are freely used.

## Required traits and ergonomics

In the above examples, the function requiring a trait was defined like the following.

```rust,ignore
fn twice_area<T: Shape>(shape: &T) -> f64 {
    2.0 * shape.area()
}
```

This is a commonly used shorthand for the following:

```rust,ignore
fn twice_area<T>(shape: &T) -> f64
where
    T: Shape,
{
    2.0 * shape.area()
}
```

The more verbose form is preferred when there are many type parameters or those
type parameters must implement many traits.

## Generics and lifetimes

When defining a template in C++ that makes use of a type template parameter, the
lifetimes of references stored within objects of that type must be tracked
manually by the programmer.

The following (contrived) C++ example compiles without error, but could be used
in a way that results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
$#include <memory>
$
$struct Shape {
$  Shape() {}
$  virtual ~Shape() {}
$  virtual double area() = 0;
$};
$
template<typename S>
void store(S s, std::unique_ptr<Shape> data) {
    // Will pointers or references in `s` become dangling while `data`
    // is still in use?
	*data = s;
}
```

Rust checks the bounds on lifetimes of references contained within type
parameters. [Just as with trait object
types](/idioms/data_modeling/abstract_classes.md#trait-objects-and-lifetimes),
these bounds are usually inferred according to the [lifetime elision
rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html). When they
cannot be inferred, or they are inferred incorrectly, the bounds can be declared
manually.

In the Rust transliteration of the above example, the lifetime bounds have to be
given manually because the inferred bounds are incorrect. Without explicit
bounds, the compiler produces an error.

```rust,ignore
# trait Shape {}
#
fn store<S: Shape>(x: S, data: &mut Box<dyn Shape>) {
    *data = Box::new(x);
}
```

```text
error[E0310]: the parameter type `S` may not live long enough
 --> example.rs:7:5
  |
7 |     *data = Box::new(x);
  |     ^^^^^
  |     |
  |     the parameter type `S` must be valid for the static lifetime...
  |     ...so that the type `S` will meet its required lifetime bounds
  |
```

The error message becomes clearer when the inferred lifetime bounds are made
explicit. With the given type for `store`, the argument for `x` could be
something that has a lifetime that does not last as long as the lifetimes in the
contents in the box.

```rust,ignore
# trait Shape {}
#
# struct Triangle {
#     base: f64,
#     height: f64,
# }
#
# impl Shape for Triangle {}
#
// The type parameter S is assigned no lifetime bound.
fn store<'a, S: Shape>(
    x: S,
    // The reference is assigned a fresh lifetime by rule
    // [lifetime-elision.function.implicit-lifetime-parameters].
    //
    // The trait object is assigned 'static by rule
    // [lifetime-elision.trait-object.default] and
    // [lifetime-elision.trait-object.innermost-type].
    data: &'a mut Box<dyn Shape + 'static>,
) {
    *data = Box::new(x);
}

// An example of how the implementation of store could be misused with
// the given type.
fn main() {
    let triangle = Triangle {
        base: 1.0,
        height: 2.0,
    };
    let mut b: Box<dyn Shape> = Box::new(triangle);
    {
        let short_lived_triangle = Triangle {
            base: 5.0,
            height: 10.0,
        };
        store(short_lived_triangle, &mut b);
    }
    // Here b contains a dangling reference.
}
```

For this specific case, the most general solution is to define a new lifetime
parameter to bound both `S` and `dyn Shape`. The type parameter for the
reference can be elided, because it will be assigned a fresh lifetime parameter.

```rust
trait Shape {}

// Note the common bound
// -----------------here-\
// ----------------------|---------------------------and here-\
//                       v                                    v
fn store<'s, S: Shape + 's>(x: S, data: &mut Box<dyn Shape + 's>) {
    *data = Box::new(x);
}
```
