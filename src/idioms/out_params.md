# Out parameters

There are several idioms in C++ that involve the use of out parameters: passing
pointers or references to functions for the function to mutate to provide its
results.

The chapters in this section address idiomatic ways to achieve the same goals
that out parameters are used for in C++. Many of the Rust idioms resemble the
recommended alternatives to out parameters when programming against newer C++
standards.
